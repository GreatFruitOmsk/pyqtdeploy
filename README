pyqtdeploy - A Tool for Deploying PyQt5 Applications
====================================================

TODO

If you are using a dip source package then the HTML documentation, including
installation instructions, can be found in the doc/_build/html directory.

If you are using dip from the Mercurial repositiory then the following
commands are available under both UNIX and Windows.

Note that you may need to edit the ``Makefile`` and/or ``make.bat`` files to
set the value of ``PYTHON``, ``PYTHON3`` and ``PYTHON2`` to something
appropriate to your system.  On windows you may also need to modify the value
of ``SPHINXBUILD`` in ``doc\make.bat``.


Support for Python v2.6 and v2.7
--------------------------------

Support for v2.6 and v2.7 of Python is implemented as a series of patches
managed by Mercurial Queues (MQ).  To enable support for MQ make sure your
``.hgrc`` contains the following::

    [extensions]
    hgext.mq =

In order to apply the patches run the following command::

    hg qpush -a

In order to remove the patches, restoring the code to run under Python v3, run
the following command::

    hg qpop -a


make test
---------

This runs the test suite.  This is also the default when ``make`` is run
without arguments.

If you are using Python v2.6 then you must have the ``unittest2`` package
installed.


make doc
--------

This creates the documentation.  You will need to have Python v2, Sphinx and
the Mercurial Python bindings installed.


make dist
---------

This creates distutils source packages for both UNIX and Windows.  You will
need to have Python v2 and the Mercurial Python bindings installed.


make clean
----------

This removes any generated files, excluding any distutils source packages.


make dist-clean
---------------

This removes any generated files, including any distutils source packages.
