Updating pyqtdeploy When New Versions are Released
==================================================

These notes assume that immediately prior releases are fully supported by
pyqtdeploy.


Python
------

pyconfig.h
..........

For Windows copy the ``PC/pyconfig.h`` file to the ``configurations/pyconfig``
directory replacing any existing copy for the same major.minor version.  Edit
the file and replace the ``#define`` for ``HAVE_DYNAMIC_LOADING`` with
``@PY_DYNAMIC_LOADING@``.

For other platforms ``diff`` the ``pyconfig.h.in`` file to see if there are any
new configuration items.  Add any new ones to ``pyconfig.py``.


python.pro
..........

Run ``./configure`` for the new version and inspect the generated ``Makefile``.

Compare the value of ``PARSER_OBJS`` with the value of ``PARSER_SOURCES`` in
``python.pro``.

Compare the value of ``OBJECT_OBJS`` with the value of ``OBJECT_SOURCES`` in
``python.pro``.

Compare the value of ``PYTHON_OBJS`` with the value of ``PYTHON_SOURCES`` in
``python.pro``.  Note that ``frozen.o`` should be ignored.

Compare the value of ``MODULE_OBJS`` with the value of ``MODULE_SOURCES`` in
``python.pro``.

Compare the value of ``MODOBJS`` with the value of ``MOD_SOURCES`` in
``python.pro``.
